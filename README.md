## Welcome! I'm Ian 🧑‍🌾 🌄 💾 📖

A Computer Science student at CU Boulder with a passion for building the bridge between software development and IT operations. As an aspiring DevOps Engineer, I spend my time automating infrastructure, securing systems, and tinkering in my homelab. This GitHub is my workshop where I document my projects and learning journey in Computer Science and IaC.

## 🧠 My Current Focus

I'm currently focused on building a holistic skill set that spans software development, IT operations, and project management.
Building a T-Shaped Foundation: I'm complementing my Computer Science degree with professional certifications to build a holistic understanding of the tech lifecycle:

  🔐 Security+: For writing secure and resilient code.

  ⚙️ ITIL: For understanding IT service management and operations.

  📈 CAPM: For learning project management and efficient delivery.

Hands-On DevOps & IaC: My main passion is my homelab, where I'm using Proxmox, Terraform, Ansible, Packer, and Kubernetes to automate everything from bare-metal provisioning to application deployment.

Practical Cybersecurity Skills: I'm actively sharpening my defensive security knowledge by working through the TryHackMe Defensive Security Path.
